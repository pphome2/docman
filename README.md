Mini documentation manager for download.

Mini:
- No need CMS, only use it.
- No user managment, only one passcode in config file.
- No need install, only copy to folder, and add rights for web users.

The administrative interface is accessible by clicking on the "A" 
link in the footer. 

You can create a new section, which is a directory, here you can 
upload the files. The section can be deleted. You can delete the 
uploaded files one by one. Only empty section can be deleted. The 
user interface only displays the section that is not empty. All 
displayed messages are in the "config.php" file, they can be 
translated into another language.
